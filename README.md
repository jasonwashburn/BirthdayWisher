#Birthday Wisher

A python script that uses the gmail smtp server to send a randomly chosen, customized birthday message to the 
contacts listed in birthdays.csv

**To Use**: Rename the example_config.py to config.py and enter your gmail credentials.

*Note: You must enable less secure apps for your google account. For this reason, I **strongly** recommend using a new gmail
account rather than your main.*
